    <p>
       Iâ€™m Edwin Saenz. I am a Business management student at Lehman College of the City
        University of New York. I am in my last semester. I have no experience with HTML and 
        CSS because I chose this class to learn about because I think it is something important to know 
        because it can help me in the future. I am taking CMP 128 because I believe that everyone should 
        be able to create websites in this modern era and that we all should have basic knowledge of 
        programming.
